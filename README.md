# pooler-go

pooler-go is a small middleware, providing painless HTTP request-scoped object pooling capabilities.

What does that mean? pooler-go provides a simple middleware with an object pool. You take all the objects
you need, and pooler-go cleans them up after the request has ended.

Internally, pooler-go injects a holder into each request context. That key is user-definable - make sure
it is immutable, and don't mix pools for different objects.

Detailed documentation can be found on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/kernle32dll/pooler-go).

## Why

Pooling objects in http requests is hard.

The main issue to fight here is the question, when an object can be returned to the pool. It is tempting to just `defer`, but that might be be to early. Consider a middleware, which fetches data via an arbitrary user-provided method (e.g. a function, or something service-like). Said method should create and fill the object. But that method is not able to properly judge when the request has ended, and a `defer` call there would return the object to the pool too soon. On the other hand, the middleware has no idea of the pooling, and is not able to help either. One might consider moving the pooling to the middleware then. But this just moves the problem up a layer, and makes writing type agnostic middlewares much harder.

Thus, pooler-go was born. pooler-go, used as an middleware, provides an object pool which can be accessed anytime in code wrapped by the middleware. Coming back to above example, this would allow the data providing method to retrieve objects from a pool without the need to put them back. When the middleware has finished, pooler-go takes care of the cleanup.

## Getting started

pooler-go is straight-forward to use. Initialize the middleware via `pooler.NewMiddleware(...)`,
use the middleware for your requests, and then retrieve new objects in your handler(s) via
`pooler.Get(...)`. No handing back required - pooler-go cleans up after the request has ended.

Take note to pass the **request** context (or a derived context) into the Get method.
Otherwise, pooler-go is unable to get the right internal holder.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/kernle32dll/pooler-go"

	"encoding/json"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

// User is a just sample struct for showcasing.
type User struct {
	Name string
	Time time.Time
}

const poolerKey = iota

func main() {
	router := http.NewServeMux()

	middleware := pooler.NewMiddleware(poolerKey, func() interface{} {
		log.Println("New object created")
		return &User{}
	})

	router.Handle("/user", middleware(
		http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			user := pooler.Get(r.Context(), poolerKey).(*User)

			user.Name = "Bj√∂rn Gerdau"
			user.Time = time.Now()

			decoder := json.NewEncoder(w)
			if err := decoder.Encode(user); err != nil {
				panic(err)
			}
		}),
	))

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
}
```

## Compatibility

pooler-go is automatically tested against Go 1.13.X, 1.14.X and 1.15.X.
